# bikeshare-station-optimization

This repository includes two files: the ArcGIS Pro Tool toolbox used to process relevant geospatial input criteria and export it into .csv files, and the Bikeshare Optimization program using CPLEX to optimize the location of stations based on variables from those .csv files.
